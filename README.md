# Newsfeed
This newsfeed feature was created upon an internal client's request. Previously, this client from the organization's Communications team had manually sent out weekly organization-wide emails regarding the latest mentions of the organization in the media, particularly news articles found online. The email listed out for each article, the date it was published, the headline, as well as the first 3 sentences of the article. This tended to be a lengthy email that was cluttering inboxes for staff all across the organization. 

The client's request was to custom-code a newsfeed that could be added to one of the organization's most used SharePoint sites so that any staff members can take quick reads of the organization-related news. Thus, I used HTML, Javascript, and CSS to develop a newsfeed that replaced the manual act of sending out lengthy emails.
